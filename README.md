This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation framework with the `$expr` and `$size` operators.  The issue arises when attempting to filter documents based on the size of an array field. The original query produces incorrect results or throws an error. The solution shows how to correctly filter documents according to the size of the array field using the proper aggregation framework pipeline steps.
